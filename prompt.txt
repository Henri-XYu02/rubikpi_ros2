I am supposed to utilize the camera to traverse certain waypoints. I will be running the code on a rubikpi.
Read the robot_vision code and tell me how to get image from camera, and how can I calibrate the camera.
I can place some coke cans on the ground as landmarks and use a YOLO model to detect objects.
How can I write the control loop to traverse those waypoints?


I am supposed to utilize the camera to traverse certain waypoints. I will be running the code on a rubikpi.
The camera will publish on topics of /camera/image_raw
I will use apriltag detector in /apriltag_ros to detect the artificial Apriltag markers, which will publish topics in 

/tf (type: tf2_msgs/msg/TFMessage)
detections (type: apriltag_msgs/msg/AprilTagDetectionArray)

In hw_1_solution, there is an open_loop solution that does not take any observation to traverse the waypoints. Take a look at hw_1_solution/hw_1_solution/hw_1_solution.py, and convert that to a closed-loop solution to utilize apriltag information.
